# Symbiotic Test of Knowledge

An interactive quiz inspired by the original “Anoma Mega Quiz” flow — rebuilt for **@symbioticfi**.
- Fully rebranded (Anoma → Symbiotic)
- Symbiotic-green theme (tweak HEX in `:root --symbiotic-green` if needed)
- Three tiers: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced**
- “Play All Levels” mode to run questions sequentially like the original

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step needed.

## Customize
- Update brand color in `styles.css` → `--symbiotic-green`.
- Edit or extend questions in `questions.js` (keep structure).
- All logic in `script.js` is framework-free vanilla JS.

## What’s important for you to do
1. **Confirm the exact @symbioticfi green HEX** and set it in `styles.css` (`--symbiotic-green`).
2. **Review Q&A** in `questions.js` for accuracy and tone (update/add more as needed).
3. **Host it** (Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static host).
4. **Share link** and encourage community to post scores using the built-in **Share on X** button.
